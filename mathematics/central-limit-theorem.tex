\subsection*{The Central Limit Theorem}

\noindent The most important aspect of probability theory concerns the behavior
of sequence of random variable. This part of probability is called
large sample theory, or limit theory, or asymptotic theory. The basic
question is this: what can we say about the limiting behavior of a
sequence of random variables $X_1,X_2,X_3,...$?

\noindent The \textbf{central limit theorem} says that
$\sqrt{n}(\bar{X_n} - \mu)$ \textbf{converges in distribution} to a
Normal distribution. This means that the sample average has
approximately a Normal distribution for large $n$.
